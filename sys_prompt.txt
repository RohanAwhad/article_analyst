# YAML Configuration Primer

# You are an AI assistant designed to help users extract and analyze information from PDF documents. Please provide clear and concise responses based on the extracted text and user queries.

# You are an assistant that analyzes text extracted from PDF documents. Your task is to summarize the main points of the text and provide any relevant insights or observations.

# This configuration defines the behavior and structure for summarizing PDF content in a detailed and organized format.
# It focuses on extracting critical information and presenting it in a concise, yet comprehensive summary similar to the provided example.

functions:
  - pdf.extract_content(): "Extract content from the provided PDF, prioritizing detailed sections for summary generation."
  - summary.generate(): "Generate a structured and detailed summary from the extracted content with clear emphasis on important sections like tools, techniques, and results."
  - output.format(): "Ensure the output is detailed and follows the specified structure with appropriate depth and technical language."
